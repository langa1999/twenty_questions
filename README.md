### Welcome to the 20 Questions Game!

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **Configure the `.env` File**  
   - Add your OpenAI API key 
   - Specify the topic for the game


2. **Run the Game**  
   Execute the program by running:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

#### Future improvements:
- Add logic to ensure the guesser does not ask a repeated question.
- Break down the guesser agent into two agents (one to generate questions and another for guessing the topic).
